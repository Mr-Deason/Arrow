Assignment Overview:
This is the first project that ask us to write a network program to create the communication between the client 
and sever. There are two protocol mechanisms: TCP and UDP. The design of TCP is that: the server contains 
a SeverSocket object to provide TCP connections and a Socket object used to communicate while the client only 
contains a Socket object. When the connection is successful, these two Sockets communicate with each other. 
The design of UDP is that: when the data is to be sent, a datagram packet should be created, where the hostname 
and receive port should be defined. Then the DatagramSocket method send() need to be called to send datagram. 
When the data is to be received, a designated port DatagramSocket should be created. Then the method receive() 
needs to be called to receive the datagram and store it in the buffer. Finally, call the method getData() to 
achieve the data. In addition, we also achieved three options in both UDP and TCP: put(key value), get(key) and 
delete(key).
